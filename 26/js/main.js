// JavaScript variables

/*

A variable is a “named storage” for data.
Placeholder

six data types are Primitive(predefined).

	1. Numbers: 5, 6.5, 7, etc.

	2. String: “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc.

	3. Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false.

	4. Null: This type has only one value: null.

	5. Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.

	6. Object: It is the most important data type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.



There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).

	➣The name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.

	➣After the first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example, value1.

	➣JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example, x and X are different variables.
